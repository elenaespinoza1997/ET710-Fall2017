							<p>A freak show is an exhibition of biological rarities, referred to as "freaks of nature". Typical features would be physically
								 unusual humans, such as those uncommonly large or small, those with both male and female secondary sexual characteristics,
								 people with other extraordinary diseases and conditions, and performances that are expected to be shocking to the viewers.
								 Heavily tattooed or pierced people have sometimes been seen in freak shows, as have attention-getting physical performers
								 such as fire-eating and sword-swallowing acts.</p>



							<p> n the mid-16th century, freak shows became popular pastimes in England.[1] Deformities began to be treated as objects of
								interest and entertainment, and the crowds flocked to see them exhibited. A famous early modern example was the exhibition at
								 the court of Charles I of Lazarus and Joannes Baptista Colloredo, two conjoined brothers born in Genoa, Italy. While Lazarus
								 was handsome and functioning, his parasitic brother just dangled before him in a mass of limbs from his chest. When Lazarus wa
								 s not exhibiting himself, he covered his brother with his cloak to avoid unnecessary attention.
As well as crazy exhibitions, freak shows were popular in the taverns and fairgrounds where the freaks were often combined with talent
displays. For example, in the 18th century, Matthias Buchinger, born without arms or lower legs, entertained crowds with astonishing displays of
 magic and musical ability, both in England and later, Ireland.  </p>
